<h2>Poem About Me</h2>
<p>Growing up I thought people were born with their heads cocked, because that's how they always looked at me, a girl in a foreign country.&nbsp;Growing up I thought people were born wh their heads cocked, because that's how they always looked at me, a girl in a foreign country.</p>
<p>Boxes, check one, check other.</p>
<p>People don't know, they don't furrow between the layers like I do.</p>
<p>They don't switch and flick and actively make the decisions of which...</p>
<p>Which part of me belongs today?</p>
<p>Which aspect of my personality with offend the least and blend the most, and work and succeed and bury the lead like a switchboard of traits that decided my fate and I'm always the imposter.</p>
<p>Always lost, always asking for directions, and people point my way like a scarecrow, like tornadoes blowing me whichever way the wind blows.</p>
<p>Well, Dorothy doesn't want to play today, she's becoming the machiavellian because she cares.</p>
<p>The box is empty, and glaring and daring me to choose one.</p>
<p>Well, I'm an expert at boxes, my whole life can fit in just about one, and I've got it down to a science.</p>
<p>I can pack my entire identity in an hour, 'cause where there's roots there's power.</p>
<p>But, I am all topsoil. My blood runs like oil and water refusing to stick.</p>
<p>Those secret library books, read in old library nooks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The phone camera that locks all my memories in a flash, saved for when my recollection doesn't last.</p>
<p>That computer that sparked that fire and the memories of those passwords, are all ready in a box to be carried door to door</p>
<p>But that's never the kind of box anyone ever asks for.</p>
