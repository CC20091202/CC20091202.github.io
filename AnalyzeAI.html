<h2>Original AI Essay:</h2>
<p>Our world is rapidly changing, and with the rise of technology and artificial intelligence, it's becoming increasingly difficult to predict what our future may look like. While there are many possibilities for the future of our world, one potential outcome that has been explored in literature and film is that of a dystopian society. Dystopian stories often portray a world where freedom has been taken away from its citizens, replaced by oppressive governments or powerful corporations. In these stories, citizens are often forced to live in a state of fear or servitude due to extreme control over their lives. Through these tales, we can explore the potential consequences of unchecked power and technology on our society.</p>

<p>Our world is becoming increasingly dystopian as governments around the world are taking more control over their citizens. We can see this in the form of increased surveillance, censorship, and other forms of restrictions on our freedom. This has led to a decrease in trust in government institutions and an increase in fear of the unknown.</p>

<p>The rise of technology has enabled governments to monitor our activities, track our movements, and even manipulate public opinion. This is a worrying trend that could lead to a future where we have no privacy or autonomy from the governmentâ€™s watchful eye. It also raises questions about how much control we should allow governments to have over us and what kind of society we want to live in.</p>

<p>Our world today is a far cry from the utopian visions of the past. We are living in a dystopian reality, where our lives are becoming increasingly complex and uncertain. The rise of technology, climate change, and inequality has left us with a world that is deeply divided and turbulent. We must take action to ensure that our future is not one of despair but one of hope and progress. To do this, we must understand how these issues have come to be and how they can be addressed in order to create a better future for all.</p>

<h2>Analyzation of Essay:</h2>
<p>This essay is written by AI Writer rytr.me. It's an original piece talking about the cultural impact of dystopia on our world. First, let's talk about the benefits of rytr.me and the pros of this AI generated essay. This piece of literature indulges the reader in the dystopian fantasy of out world. It introduces how us humans have impacted the world on becoming more of a depressed systopian society. This essay leaves an impact on the reader making them want to help change the world, meaning it has an exceptional amount of spiritual value. This essay also uses much artistry and imagery describing how dystopia is appearing in our cities and what a dystopian future means. For some improvements and cons, this essay is much too informal and repeptitive. For example every paragraph has the same central plot and also all begin with the words "Our world." This makes the reader bored and unwilling to read any further. This essay is also exrememly casual. For a piece that I described as "a formal essay on the appearance of dystopian societies on our Earth," This essay is not nearly as formal enough. All in all, I would definitely use rytr.me for last-minute essays, but I would still need to edit through the AI generated draft to make sure my points were made clear. </p>
