<p>These are two pictures made by an AI painter called nightcafe.studio. These two images share the same backstory and concept, but depict them in different art forms. Related to my AI Video and AI Literature piece, both of these are also about a futurist dystopian city.</p>
	<p>The image on the left has a lot going on at the moment. This represents the amount of chaos possible when a city turns dystopian. There is a main building at the top representing the ruling government and at the bottom it's a whirlpool of messed up buildings representing the struggling people within the government's grasp.</p>
	<p>This art piece on the right is of a dystopian city as well. Except, for this city it's more fantasy-like and calmer. It may remind you of a simple hobbit neighborhood etc. This has been photoshopped by me as well to help with the quality and backstory. I added two symbols of my own along with a castle in the background.</p>
<p>Suggested, optional background audio</p>
