<h1>Introductions to AI Video</h1>
<body>
<p>My AI generated video expands on the ideas of my AI literature piece - Our World Becoming Dystopian. This video is a summary of the article and adapted into visuals as well. This video was made in Pictory AI Video Editor and can be chosen to be played with the original audio, or my audio of choice on the side. The subtitles will explain and summarize the points of why our world is becoming more dystopian by the moment. It will list out a few reasons along with colorful visuals. This video was based off of what I saw our world as after reading Dystopian worlds and their screenplay adaptions. It will cover which parts of our environment and government is taking control over our own decisions of freedom. Enjoy!</p>
