<h2>J.A.R.V.I.S - Just Another Really Very Intelligent System</h2>


<h2>Basic Questions with JARVIS</h2>
<p>Jarvis is the world's most powerful and advanced artificial intelligence system. Jarvis has the ability to answer questions based off of his knowledge from the internet. Some similarities to Alexa or Google Home, but the similarities end there. Jarvis can expand on answers and can recieve feedback from the owner of which answers are preferred. For an example, when one asks Jarvis a mathematical question from their homework, Jarvis can explain the answer using information from websites and video explanations to best solve for the most appropriate answer. You, the owner of Jarvis, can tell him that you prefer a specific method or a specified way of solving. This way, in the future, Jarvis can help you with more efficient and appropriate methods and techniques.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Jarvis's Daily Report System</h2>
<p>Jarvis's Daily Report System will be said aloud to you every day at your chosen time. Jarvis's Daily Report System can include reporting the weather, traffic, telling you when sunris/sundown/golden hour is, reporting how long your device battery will last (device has to be plugged into Jarvis's charging system), and the breaking news of that day. Of course this is not all Jarvis is able to report, you can add or eliminate other options such as "Quote of the day", today's birthday roundup (including celebrities and your close people's birthdays if you entered them into Jarvis's app), and trending tv shows; movies; books, and etc. You can choose the time of day you would like all this information to be reported to you.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Education with Jarvis</h2>
<p>Jarvis is not just a report and Q&amp;A system, Jarvis can also help with work and/or school. Jarvis has a system where he is able to scan your documents and articulate the homework problems. Jarvis can type up essays within a few second and can solve reading comprehension, mathematical word problems/equations, science problems, and language arts questions (available in 7000 languages).&nbsp;</p>
